# ATS Optimization Guide

Guide to optimizing your CV for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

## 🤖 What is ATS?

Applicant Tracking Systems are software used by companies to manage job applications. They:
- Parse and store resumes
- Filter candidates based on keywords
- Rank applicants by match score
- Help recruiters manage the hiring process

**Why it matters:** If your CV isn't ATS-friendly, it might never reach a human recruiter.

## ✅ ATS-Friendly Formatting

### Do's
- ✅ **Use standard fonts** - Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman, Georgia
- ✅ **Use standard headings** - "Work Experience", "Education", "Skills"
- ✅ **Save as PDF or Word** - Both work, but PDF is preferred
- ✅ **Use simple formatting** - Bullet points, bold, italics (sparingly)
- ✅ **Include keywords** - From the job description
- ✅ **Use standard date formats** - "MM/YYYY" or "Month YYYY"
- ✅ **Keep it simple** - Clean, straightforward layout

### Don'ts
- ❌ **Avoid graphics/images** - ATS can't read them
- ❌ **No tables or columns** - ATS struggles with complex layouts
- ❌ **Avoid headers/footers** - Can be cut off by ATS
- ❌ **No fancy fonts** - Stick to standard fonts
- ❌ **Avoid text boxes** - ATS can't parse them well
- ❌ **No special characters** - Use standard punctuation

## 🔑 Keyword Optimization

### How to Find Keywords
1. **Read the job description** carefully
2. **Identify required skills** - Technical and soft skills
3. **Note industry terms** - Domain-specific language
4. **Look for repeated phrases** - These are likely important
5. **Check similar job postings** - Find common keywords

### Where to Place Keywords
- **Skills section** - List relevant skills
- **Work experience** - Use keywords naturally in descriptions
- **Summary/Objective** - Include key terms
- **Job titles** - Match job title terminology when possible

### Keyword Strategy
- **Use exact phrases** from job description when natural
- **Include variations** - "Android" and "Android Development"
- **Don't keyword stuff** - Use keywords naturally
- **Match their language** - Use their terminology

## 📝 ATS-Friendly CV Structure

### Recommended Sections (in order)
1. **Contact Information** - Name, phone, email, LinkedIn
2. **Professional Summary** - 2-3 sentences with keywords
3. **Skills** - List of relevant skills
4. **Work Experience** - Reverse chronological
5. **Education** - Degrees and certifications
6. **Additional Sections** - Projects, certifications, languages (if relevant)

### Section Headings
Use standard headings that ATS recognizes:
